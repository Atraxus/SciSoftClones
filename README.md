# SciSoftClones
Here you can find the replication package for my bachelors' thesis: "Code Clones in Scientific Software: A Case Study on Ray-UI". All the code I wrote for the thesis is provided here.
This includes:
- Additions to the tools 
- Scripts for analysis
- Excel files to create graphs

The source code won't be shared since it is not fully open source. If you are interested in reproducing the results, please let me know under maierjan (at) informatik.hu-berlin.de. 
The tools are also not distributed with this repository, but links are provided in the CCDTools folders' README.
